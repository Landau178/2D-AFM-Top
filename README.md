# 2D-AFM-Top
### This repository will contains some tight binding simulations of AFM and FM
### materials such as:

###         1.- CrAs2
###         2.- MnX3: Noncollinear AFM in the Kagome Lattice

### We will use the pythb library, cause its simplicity in working
### with topological quantities, like berry curvatures.
